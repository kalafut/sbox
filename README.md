*DON'T USE*

sbox allows you to augment any "folder than syncs" provider in a secure manner. There are commercial solutions for this, such as [Boxcryptor](https://www.boxcryptor.com), but all of them involve installing complicated closed source software. sbox is intended to forego elaborate features and focus on simplicity.

Goals
=====

* Secure. Use only will established crypto tools with no hand-rolled solutions.
* Simple to use. Rely on existing network cloud sync solutions.
* Simple to verify. Users should be able to easily review and understand the source code.
